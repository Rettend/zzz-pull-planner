# TODO

## FIX

- [x] pull 1 and pull 10 buttons to quickly change available pulls and pity
- [x] mindscape support with nice ui, maybe small + - buttons for targets
- [x] planner should work for N phases, currently 2 phases are hardcoded, and even first banner is in the second phase
- [ ] add A rank support
- [ ] perf fix: accounts tab without unmounting?
- [ ] vitest

<!--
alright, let's add A rank support to the app!

it will be tricky since the target selector was made for S ranks only, and the layout is very tidy.
